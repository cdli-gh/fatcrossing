# fatcrossing
**Prepared by Émilie Pagé-Perron**

This script assemble 6 tiff images of sides of an artifact into a draft tiff fatcross with each side on it's own layer.  

To work as expected, this script needs to be run in your folder containg the images, images which should be named following the method described here: https://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/docs/images-acquisition-and-processing#content-scanning-one-cuneiform-document  
You can also use the next method scanning multiple artifacts but you will need to segment the images and name them according to the previous model for this to work.
